- test scenario:
	current state: (2.8,3.2,4.0,3.1)
	goal state: (3.5,2.5,2.8,4.5)
- environment dynamics assumptions:
	big_random_low = 50
        big_random_high = 60

        small_random_low = 3
        small_random_high = 10
- environment dynamics actual:
        big_random_low = 86
        big_random_high = 88

        small_random_low = 19
        small_random_high = 21
- interpretation:
	1. moving to a warmer, brighter, and drier climate
	2. assumptions underestimate effects of both big and small actions
