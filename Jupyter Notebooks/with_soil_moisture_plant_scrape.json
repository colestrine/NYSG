So they don't naturally have strong resistance to plant diseases that thrive under our generally humid conditions. Fortunately, many hybrids have been bred specifically for disease resistance, and some open-pollinated varieties tolerate certain diseases. Appearance:Appearance: Colors range from the familiar red to orange and yellow, pink and multicolored fruits. Size and shape range from huge round beefsteaks to elongated pasters to tiny cherry and grape tomatoes and everything in between.Use:Use: Some are better than others for a multitude of uses:  slicing, salads, sauces, canning, juice etc.Determinate vs. indeterminate:Determinate vs. indeterminate: Determinate varieties produce many short branches with flowers and fruit on the ends. They are usually early varieties and produce their harvest all at once. Indeterminate varieties will continue to grow and produce flowers and fruit all season until killed by frost, and are most common in gardens. Semi-determinate plants are more compact than indeterminate, but keep producing until frost. Days to harvest:Days to harvest: This is roughly how long after transplanting (not seed planting) you can expect first ripe fruit. Keep in mind that cool, cloudy weather will slow expected growth. Use days-to-maturity as a guide to distinguish varieties as early (65 days or less), mid-season (65 to 80 days) and late-season (80 days or more). In some cooler areas of New York, only early-season varieties can be expected to mature.You will find hundreds of varieties to choose from in seed catalogs and at garden centers. (It's estimated that there are 25,000 to 40,000 varieties worldwide.) When choosing what to grow from seed or when purchasing plants at the garden center, consider:VarietiesVerticillium wilt - Use same cultural control strategies as above. Plant resistant varieties such as Supersonic, Jackpot, Basketvee, Sunny, Jet Star and Springset. Fusarium wilt - Use same cultural control strategies as above. Plant resistant varieties such as Pik-Red, Better Boy, Duke, Freedom, Supersonic, Jet Star, Springset and Floramerica.Late blight - Use same cultural control strategies as above. The fungus that causes late blight has recently become a major threat to home gardens and commercial growers because of migration of new more aggressive strains (genotypes) into the United States.   Verification of late blight diagnosis and implementation of prompt control measures are hightly recommended. Cultural controls mentioned above may not adequately control these new strains. Early blight, Septoria leaf spot - Locate new plants in a part of the garden different from previous year's location. Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. Practice plant sanitation. When plants are not wet, carefully remove and destroy affected plant parts. In autumn, rake and dispose of all diseased leaves and stalks. Septoria occurs early in the season, preferring cool, wet weather. Use clean transplants and remove lower infected leaves.Catface - Grow locally recommended varieties and provide adequate fertilizer and water for vigorous growth.Diseases:Flea beetles - Use row covers to help protect plants from early damage. Use in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot. Control weeds. Cutworms - Control weeds.  Cardboard collars around each plant give good protection.Colorado potato beetle - Handpick and destroy beetles, eggs and larvae.Whiteflies - Do not purchase whitefly-infested transplants.  Inspect carefully before purchasing.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests:Catfacing (misshapen, deformed fruit) is caused by incomplete pollination, usually due to cold weather. Don\u2019t rush to transplant until weather has stabilized and soil is warm. Do not remove leaves that shade fruit to prevent sunscald.  Keep soil evenly moist to prevent blossom end rot. This can also help prevent cracking when fruit absorbs water too fast after heavy rain following dry conditions. To avoid other common tomato problems:On most soils, you can sidedress about 1/2 cup of 5-10-5 per plant and work shallowly into the top inch of soil when fruits are about 1 inch in diameter and again when harvest begins.Avoid excessive N applications, which can cause excessive foliage and poor fruit set. Also avoid using fresh manure or high nitrogen fertilizers (those with three or more times nitrogen than phosphorus or potassium). Poor fruit set can also be caused by heavy rainfall or temperatures that are either too high (above 90 F) or too low (below 55 F). Growing tomatoes in cages is a good compromise between labor-intensive staking and just letting them sprawl. You can purchase tomato cages at your local garden center, or simply bend a 6-foot-long piece of 4- to 6-inch wire mesh into a cylinder about 22 inches in diameter. (Cattle fencing or concrete reinforcing wire mesh work well for this.) Place cage around plants soon after transplanting and anchor with stakes.Prune tomatoes to one or two vigorous stems by snapping off \u201csuckers\u201d (stems growing from where leaf stems meet the main stem) when they are 2 to 4 inches long. Tie stems to stake with soft string, twine or cloth, forming a figure-8 with the stem in one loop and the stake in the other. This gives the stem room to expand without being constricted. Start about 8 to 12 inches above the ground and continue to tie at similar intervals as the plant grows. As an alternative to using individual stakes, grow several plants in a row between heavy-duty stakes or posts spaced about 4 feet apart, and use twine to weave in and out around posts and plants.Wooden tomato stakes are typically about 6 feet long and 1 \u00bd inch square, but you can use similar materials. Drive stakes at least 8 to 10 inches deep at or soon after transplanting so as not to damage roots.How you provide support to plants can also affect performance. Determinate varieties do not need staking. But staking and pruning indeterminate varieties can hasten first harvest by a week or more, improve fruit quality, keep fruit cleaner, and make harvest easier. Staking and pruning usually reduces total yield, but fruits will tend to be larger. Staked and pruned plants are also more susceptible to blossom end rot and sunscald. Allowing indeterminate varieties to sprawl reduces labor, but takes up more space and plants are more prone to disease.Many factors (in addition to your choice of variety) affect total yield, first harvest and fruit quality. Raised beds, black plastic mulch and providing consistent moisture by watering or through drip irrigation are good ways to improve all three.Mulch plants after the soil has warmed up to maintain soil moisture and suppress weeds. Tomatoes need a consistent supply of moisture. If it rains less than 1 inch per week, water to make up the difference.To reduce root disease risk, don't plant on soils that have recently grown tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or eggplant for at least two years. Unlike most plants, tomatoes do better if planted deeper than they were grown in containers. Set them in the ground so that the soil level is just below the lowest leaves. Roots will form along the buried stem, establishing a stronger root system.24 to 36 inches apart for unstaked indeterminate varieties14 to 20 inches apart for staked indeterminate varieties12 to 24 inches apart for determinate varietiesSpace transplants:Harden off plants before transplanting by reducing water and fertilizer, not by exposing to cold temperatures, which can stress them and stunt growth. Transplants exposed to cold temperatures (60 F to 65 F day and 50 F to 60 F night) are more prone to catfacing.Don\u2019t rush to transplant, either. Cold soil and air temperatures can stress plants. Wait at least a week or two after the last frost. Nighttime temperatures should be consistently above 45 F. Use black plastic mulch to warm soil and/or row covers, hot caps or other protection to keep plants warm early in the season. Remove covers whenever temperatures exceed 85 F.Don\u2019t start plants too early. Sow seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting outside. Plant them 1/8 inch deep in sterile seed starting mix in flats or cells. Seeds germinate best at 75 F to 90 F. Then grow transplants at about 70 F.Starting your own plants from seed gives you more choices of which variety to grow. But if you start your own plants, be sure you have a place where they can get enough light. Even a sunny, south-facing window is barely adequate. Consider using a grow light to supplement sunlight.

Any of these shapes may be either sweet or hot. In cooler areas of the state, choose short-season varieties.  Disease-resistant varieties are good for warm, humid conditions.VarietiesBlossom end rot - Water during drought or mulch to keep moisture level constant. Grow in soil high in organic matter. Fertilize properly. Avoid cultivating close to plants. Diseases:Other pests:Tarnished plant bugs Borers - Remove  by hand.  Destroy infested plants.Pests:Do not plant in same spot more than once every 4 years. Peppers need even moisture for best performance. An even supply can reduce blossom end rot, a disorder caused by lack of calcium.Stake tall varieties for earlier and heavier harvest.Too much nitrogen fertilizer may promote lush vegetative growth but fewer fruits. Peppers usually responds well to phosphorus fertilizer.Peppers can be temperamental when it comes to setting fruit if temperatures are too hot or too cool. Nighttime temperatures below 60 F or above 75 F can reduce fruit set.If not using black plastic, mulch plants after they are well established and the soil has warmed to retain moisture and control weeds. Use black plastic and/or row covers to speed soil warming and early growth. Use caution with row covers not to overheat plants and cause them to drop their blossoms.Set plants out 2 to 3 weeks after average last frost when the soil has warmed and the weather has settled. Plant them 12 to 24 inches apart, in rows 24 to 36 inches apart, or spaced about 14 to 16 inches apart in raised beds.Don't be in a rush to transplant outside. Cold temperatures can weaken plants and they may never fully recover. A few days at 60 F to 65 F with reduced water will help harden plants and reduce transplant shock. Over-hardened plants grow slowly after transplanting.Keep plants indoors in a warm (70 F during the day, 65 F at night), sunny location.

Some are a different species altogether, Allium fistulosum.Spring-sown early varieties can be harvested just 60 to 80 days after planting. Storage varieties require 90 to 110 days to mature from direct seeding, and come in yellow, white and purple varieties. Sweet or milder varieties do not store well, and should be eaten soon after harvest. Pearl onions (sometimes called cocktail onions) have small bulbs (great for pickling) that mature in 60 to 70 days.Choose long-day varieties which need about 14 hours of light to form bulbs. Short-day varieties, such as the famous Vidalia onions, grow best in the South.VarietiesDiseases:Thrips Pests: Onions have shallow root systems and need consistent moisture and good weed control. Water weekly if weather is dry, and mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.From sets:   Choose bulbs no larger than \u00be inch in diameter. Large bulbs are more prone to bolting. Plant sets about 1 inch deep 2 to 4 weeks before last frost date. Space 4 inches apart for large bulbs or 2 inches apart for smaller bulbs.Start transplants inside about 8 to 10 weeks before last frost date. Plant 4 or 5 seeds in each cell, or seed in flats \u00bc inch deep and \u00bd inch apart. If tops grow too tall and begin to droop, trim back to about 3 inches tall with scissors. After hardening off, transplant 2 to 4 weeks before last frost date. Space 4 inches apart for large bulbs, 2 inches apart for smaller bulbs, or 1 inch apart for scallions.Direct-seed in spring when the soil reaches 50 F.

Thin to 4-inch spacings for large bulbs, 2-inch spacings for smaller bulbs but higher yields, or 1-inch spacings for scallions.Direct-seeding in the garden may not allow enough time for long-season varieties to mature, but is fine for shorter-season varieties or for scallions - onions harvested before the bulb forms.Choose a weed-free, well-drained location. Raised beds are ideal. Onions are good for intercropping with other garden plants, especially early-maturing spring greens. Do not plant where other onion family crops have been grown in the past 3 years.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 1 year.       - Longer if stored properly in cool, dry location.

At the end of the season, remove or till in vines to reduce mildew. Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. Remove cover before flowering to allow pollination by insects or when hot weather arrives.To hasten first harvest by as much as 2 weeks, use black plastic mulch to warm soil before direct seeding or transplanting. Early fruits are sometimes wrinkled, turn black or rot due to poor pollination.For extra early crops, start inside in 2- to 3-inch pots or cells 3 to 4 weeks before transplanting outside. Sow 3 or 4 seeds per pot and thin to one or two plants by snipping off the weaker plants to avoid damaging the roots of those that remain. Harden off by cutting back on water and reducing temperature before transplanting. Plant transplants out in the garden about 1 to 2 feet apart after all danger of frost has passed.Direct seed \u00bd to 1 inch deep into hills (which warm and drain earlier in the season) or rows.

Bush varieties bear fruit slightly earlier than vining varieties, and are easier to care for and harvest.Slicing varietiesSlicing varieties have longer fruit (usually 7 to 8 inches) with a thick skin. Their coloring is sometimes stippled but is usually a uniform dark green. They usually start to bear a week or so later than pickling varieties, but harvest may continue for 4 to 6 weeks.Pickling varietiesPickling varieties bear short fruit (usually 3 to 4 inches) with thin skins and spines, usually with a stippled color pattern ranging from dark green at the stem to light green at the blossom end. They are usually ready to harvest sooner than slicing varieties, but harvest only lasts about 7 to 10 days. When choosing cucumber varieties, keep in mind:VarietiesOther diseases:AnthracnoseLeaf spot Downy mildew     Cucumber mosaic virus - Remove and discard or destroy infested plants. Plant resistant varieties such as Pacer, Marketmore 76, Dasher II, Slicemaster, Spacemaster and Sweet Success. Manage aphids that spread virus. Eliminate perennial weeds such as milkweed, marshcress and yellow rocket; and avoid planting next to susceptible ornamentals.Scab - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation.Powdery mildew - Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. In autumn, rake and dispose of all fallen or diseased leaves and fruit. Plant resistant varieties such as Marketmore 76, Slicemaster and Raider.Diseases: Squash vine borer - Remove borers by hand and destroy.  Destroy crop residues after harvest.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests: To reduce pest and disease pressure, do not plant cucumbers where you\u2019ve grown them in the last two years. Choose resistant varieties to prevent many diseases and/or trellis vining varieties to encourage good air circulation.Cucumbers are heavy feeders and require fertile soil, nitrogen fertilizer, and/or additions of high-N organic matter sources. Pale, yellowish leaves indicate nitrogen deficiency. Leaf bronzing is a sign of potassium deficiency.Most cucumbers have both male and female flowers. The male flowers blossom first and produce pollen, but no fruit. Other varieties produce female flowers predominately or exclusively. Seed packs of these varieties include a few seeds (usually marked with dye) of another variety that produces male flowers to provide pollen. Make sure you don\u2019t remove pollinator plants when thinning.To save space, train vining cucumbers to a trellis. (Make sure the trellised plants don\u2019t shade other sun-loving plants.) This also increases air circulation (reducing disease problems), makes harvest easier and produces straighter fruit. Set up trellis before planting or transplanting to avoid root injury. Space plants about 10 inches apart. Pinch back vines that extend beyond the trellis to encourage lateral growth.For a continuous harvest, make successive plantings every 2 to 3 weeks until about 3 months before first fall frost date. About 1 month before first frost, start pinching off new flowers so plants channel energy into ripening existing fruit.Plants with one or two true leaves transplant best. Transplant into black plastic mulch or warm garden soil after danger of frost has passed and weather has settled. Be careful not to damage roots when transplanting. If using peat pots, make sure they are saturated before transplanting and completely buried. If using row covers, remove when flowers begin to blossom to assure good pollination.For extra early crops, start plants inside 3 to 4 weeks before transplanting. Sow 3 seeds per pot in 2-inch pots. Thin to one or two plants per pot. Grow above 70 F during the day and above 60 F at night. Be careful when hardening-off plants not to expose them to cold temperatures. For early crops, use black plastic mulch and row covers or other protection to speed warming and protect plants. Direct seed into holes in plastic. Cucumbers seeded into black plastic usually produce larger yields, as well earlier ones.Thin to 8 to 15 inches apart in rows or 2 to 3 plants per hill. Snip off plants when thinning to avoid disturbing the roots of nearby plants.Direct-seed 1 to 1 \u00bd inches deep, either in rows (2 inches apart in rows 5 to 6 feet apart) or in hills (3 to 6 seeds per hill, hills spaced 3 to 5 feet apart).Maintenance and care:      Days to emergence: 3 to 10       - May germinate in 3 days at 80 F to 90 F.

Keep plantings well cultivated and mulched to prevent weeds from getting established. Mulch heavily around plantings to keep spreading weeds such as quackgrass from invading. While plants are salt-tolerant, the old practice of using salt to kill weeds is not recommended. With older varieties that are not all-male, weed out volunteer plants from females that set seed. Midsummer mulching with hay, straw, leaves or grass clippings helps control weeds and keep soil from drying out. (Be careful not to bring in weed seeds with your mulch.) Regular applications of compost or well-rotted manure provide a steady source of nutrients. To blanch asparagus, carefully hill soil over spears or grow under opaque buckets or row covers.Water during dry spells during the first year.  Do not overwater as plants don\u2019t tolerate water-logged soils.For highest yields, plant all-male hybrids, such as the Jersey series from Rutgers University (Jersey Giant, Jersey King, Jersey Knight). If using older varieties, such as Martha Washington, you can identify the less productive female plants at flowering and replace them with male plants. The flowers on male plants are larger and longer than the female flowers, have six stamens and a small nonfunctional pistil. The female flowers have six small nonfunctional pistils and a well developed, three-lobed stamen.Do not cut back ferns in fall until they die naturally.Plant crowns 4 to 6 weeks before average last frost, 18 to 24 inches apart in trenches 8 inches deep.

Deformed pods may be the result of lack of moisture, poor soil fertility or insect damage during blooming.Pod set is often poor when temperatures exceed 90 F. Do not use nitrogen fertilizers. Inoculating seed with rhizobium bacteria may increase yields, especially in soils where beans have not been grown before.Beans require even moisture - about 1 inch per week - especially when flowering and developing pods. If you water, avoid wetting foliage, which encourages disease. Water early in the day so foliage dries quickly. Mulch after second set of true leaves develops to help retain moisture.Relay-crop beans following harvest of cool-season crops, such as lettuce, spinach and peas.For a steady supply of beans, make successive plantings until mid- to late July.Soaking beans to hasten germination may damage seeds.

Pod color ranges from dark green to yellow (often called wax beans) and even to purple. Pods may be round or flat. (Romano types typically have broad, flat pods.) French filet varieties are slender and you should harvest them when they are 1/8 to \u00bc inch in diameter. Be sure to choose resistant varieties if you experience problems with bean diseases in your garden. You can harvest most varieties as snap beans, shell beans or dry beans. But each variety is usually best at just one of the three stages. Many heirloom varieties are available.Varieties White mold - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. In autumn rake and dispose of all fallen or diseased leaves and fruit. Crop rotation is essential.Bean common mosaic virus (BV-1 and NY 15) - Remove and discard or destroy entire infested plant along with immediately surrounding soil and soil clinging to roots. Use resistant varieties: Lancer, Provider,Blue Bush 274, Golden Butterwax, Royal Burgundy, Tendercrop, Improved Tendergreen. Manage insect vectors.Bacterial blights - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. Do not save your own seed.Diseases: Spider mites (two-spotted) - Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. A hard stream of water can be used to remove many mites from plants.Seedcorn maggot - Avoid heavy manure or organic matter in garden which attract maggot flies and encourages egg laying. Purchase insecticide-treated seed. Use gloves to plant.Leafhoppers - Small, light green to gray wedge-shaped insects that suck plant juices, causing stunting, and carrying virus diseases. No cultural control available.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests:A three-year rotation helps reduce some diseases.                     Deformed pods may be the result of lack of moisture, poor soil fertility or insect damage during blooming.Pod set is often poor when temperatures exceed 90 F.Do not use nitrogen fertilizers. Inoculating seed with rhizobium bacteria may increase yields, especially in soils where beans have not been grown before.Beans require even moisture - about 1 inch per week - especially when flowering and developing pods. If you water, avoid wetting foliage, which encourages disease. Water early in the day so foliage dries quickly. Mulch after second set of true leaves develops to help retain moisture.Soaking beans to hasten germination may damage seeds.  Do not start seed inside.  Plant seed 1 inch deep (deeper if soil is dry), in hills of four to six seeds at the base of each pole. Plant 3 inches apart in rows along the base of linear trellises.Construct trellis, teepee, or single-pole support before seeding to avoid injurying plant roots later. Bamboo poles or saplings lashed together make easy, inexpensive supports. Do not locate trellis where it will shade other plants that need full sun.

Choose short varieties for stony soil. In addition to the common red beet varieties, colors range from gold and yellow to white. Some varieties are favored for their greens, others for their long-term storage.VarietiesOther diseases:Root rots     Scab - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants Thin to allow air circulation.Diseases: Pests:Beets are biennials. Normally, they produce an enlarged root during their first season. Then after overwintering they produce a flower stalk. If they experience two to three weeks of temperatures below 45 F after they have formed several true leaves during their first season, a flower stalk may grow prematurely. Many newer varieties are less sensitive to this problem. Best color and flavor develop under cool conditions and bright sun. When beets mature in warm weather, they are lighter colored, have less sugar and have more pronounced color zoning in the roots. Fluctuating weather conditions produce white zone rings in roots.Beets tolerate average to low fertility.  Too much nitrogen will encourage top growth at the expense of root development.Beets are closely related to Swiss chard and spinach.  Avoid following these crops in rotation.Keep well-weeded.  Competition and uneven watering can make beets stringy and tough.Use floating row covers to discourage insects early in the season.Unlike most root crops, beets can be started inside or in cold frames and transplanted into the garden.Some \u201cmonogerm\u201d varieties have only one seed per fruit.  Some seed companies remove seeds from the seedball.Begin thinning when seedlings are about 4 to 5 inches tall, and eat the thinnings. Cut rather than pull plants when thinning to avoid disturbing roots of other plants.The wrinkled \u201cseedball\u201d usually contains two to four viable seeds, making it necessary to thin to 3- to 4-inch spacings if you plan to harvest young, small or cylindrical-shaped roots, or 6-inch spacings for larger roots for winter storage.

Savoy varieties are prized for their flavor as well as their good looks.Varieties may vary in head size, shape (round, flat, conical) and colors (green, red or purple).Some varieties are resistant to certain diseases and insects.Plant early, midseason and late varieties to spread out harvest. Early varieties tend not to store well. Late varieties tend to be better for storage or for making sauerkraut.VarietiesOther diseases:Cabbage yellowsBlack rotBlack leg Purple blotch (Alternaria porri ) - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants, allowing air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to increase air circulation. Practice plant sanitation. When plants are not wet, remove and destroy affected plant parts. In autumn rake and destroy all fallen or diseased leaves and fruit.Diseases:Other pests:Cabbage loopersSlugsNematodes Cutworms - Control weeds.  Cardboard collars around each plant give good protection.Flea Beetles - Use row covers to help protect plants from early damage. Put in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot in midsummer. Control weeds.Cabbageworms - Handpick and destroy. Row covers may be useful on small plantings to help protect plants from early damage. Put in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot in midsummer. Cabbage root maggot - White maggot larvae tunnel in and feed on roots of plants. Damage causes wilting early on, death of plants later on.Pests:To help reduce disease, do not plant cabbage or other cole crops in the same location more than once every three or four years. When heads are mature, they are prone to splitting in response to any stress or a rain following a dry period. Avoid splitting by choosing varieties that resist splitting, spacing plants close together (8 to 12 inches for early varieties, 12 to 16 inches for later varieties), using shovel to sever roots on one side about 6 inches from the plant, or twisting plants after heads have firmed to break some of the roots. Use floating row cover to protect crop from early pests.  Plants have shallow root systems. Avoid even shallow cultivation. Mulch to protect roots, reduce weed competition and conserve moisture.Direct seed in summer for fall crop, or start transplants in late May and transplant in late June or early July.  Can be direct seeded as soon as you can work the soil. Will germinate at soil temps as low as 40 F. Plant \u00bd to \u00be inch deep, about 3 inches apart.

All rights reserved.BoleroCosmic PurpleHealthmasterKinkoRoyal ChantenayRumba     Some varieties recommended for New York include:Choose short-season varieties for early planting and summer eating. Choose longer-season varieties for fall harvest and storage.Only grow longer varieties if your soil is deep, loose and stone- and clod-free.Imperator -- Up to 10 inches long, slender.Danvers -- Up to 7 inches long, slender, but wider at the top than the Imperator types and have strong flavor.Nantes -- Up to 7 inches long, more cylindrical than tapered, sweet flavor.Chantenay -- Up to 5 inches, wide at the top and tapering.Amsterdam -- Up to 3 inches long, thin and slender, good for early harvest and less-than-ideal soil conditions.Paris Market -- Round, short, about 1 \u00bd inches in diameter. Carrot varieties generally fall into one of six types:Varieties Other pests:SlugsLeafhopper - Leafhoppers spread disease causing carrots to be woody, hairy and bitter.  No cultural control is available.Carrot weevil - Clean up garden debris in autumn.  Beneficial nematodes are available. Apply as directed on label.Carrot rust fly - Harvest all carrots by September 1 in upstate New York, by August 20 farther South, to avoid second brood injury.Pests:To prevent diseases, don\u2019t plant carrots in the same spot more than once every 3 years.                     Root quality is best when soil temperatures are 60 F to 70 F. The shape of the root is determined within the first few weeks after germination when the new plant extends its taproot deep into the soil. If it encounters obstacles (such as rocks or high water table) or is damaged, shape and quality of the root will suffer.Make additional plantings every three weeks through midsummer for continuous supply and fall harvest. Sowing in very early spring is possible, but some varieties will bolt if temperatures are too cold. Plant crops for fall harvest about 10 to 12 weeks before first frost.Mulch to keep soil cool, conserve moisture and to keep exposed \"shoulders\" from turning green and bitter. Another option is to hill soil over the shoulders.Use seed tape or pelleted seed for more even spacings and less thinning. Or mix seed in roughly equal proportions with sand, fine vermiculite, or dried coffee grounds.Tip: Sow radishes in the same row. They germinate quickly, break the soil crust, and mark the row. Thin and/or harvest radishes before they compete with carrots.To improve germination in dry weather: Make a small furrow, about 2 inches deep. Plant seed and cover with about \u00bd inch of soil. Cover furrow with a board to retain soil moisture until seeds germinate.Thinning is critical to reduce competition from neighboring plants. Thin to 1- to 4-inch spacings (depending on size of root desired) before plants are 2 inches tall. Cutting rather than pulling reduces disturbance of the remaining plants.Carrots are slow to germinate (1 to 3 weeks), and often germinate unevenly over a period of several weeks. To speed germination, water lightly daily if soil is dry. Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 3 years.                  Days to emergence: 7 to 21                  Germination temperature: 50 F to 85 F       - Will germinate at temperatures as low a 40 F.

In autumn, rake and dispose of all fallen or discarded leaves and fruit.Diseases:Slugs and snailsCutworms  Other pests: Cabbage aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Cabbage root maggot - White maggots (larvae) attack all plants of the cabbage family. Larvae tunnel in and feed on roots of plants. Damage causes wilting early on, death of plants a little later on.Flea beetles - Use row covers to help protect plants from early damage. Put in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot in midsummer. Control weeds.Pests:Too much sun, heat or nitrogen fertilizer can cause \u201cricey\u201d heads where the curd separates into small, rice-like grains.                     To preserve the white color of the curd, use string or rubber bands to secure outside leaves over the head when it is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter. From tying to harvest may take less than a week in summer or as long as a month in fall.Plants have shallow root systems. Avoid even shallow cultivation. Mulch to protect roots, reduce weed competition and conserve moisture.Direct seeding is more difficult than with other cole crops, especially in spring. For fall crops, plant seed in late-spring early summer \u00bd to \u00be inch deep, about 3 inches apart. Thin to final spacings. Or start transplants in late May and transplant in late June or early July.Some cultivars will form small \u201cbutton\u201d heads when the weather turns warm following a 10-day stretch when high temperatures only reach the 40s F. Larger, older transplants are more likely to bolt when exposed to cool temperatures in the garden. Transplant when plants have four or five true leaves.Sow seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before average last spring frost. Keep soil warm (about 75 F), until germination. Then keep plants around 60 F. Provide direct sun so plants don\u2019t get leggy. When plants are 4 to 6 weeks old, transplant into garden 15 to 24 inches apart in rows 24 to 36 inches apart. Wait until soil temperature is 50 F or above and danger of frost is past before transplanting.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 5 years.

See Growing Information.Broom corn - traditionally used for making brooms - is a different species, Sorghum bicolor. If you plan to grow corn in the traditional \u201cThree Sisters\u201d planting of corn, beans and squash, choose another type of corn that you won\u2019t harvest until the ears are fully mature and dry. These include popcorn, ornamental corn or field corn (dent, flint and flour corns grown for meal or animal feed). That way, you won\u2019t have to walk on squash vines or disturb climbing beans harvesting sweet corn while the other crops are still growing.MiraiAugmented (Gourmet Sweet Brand, Multisweet, Xtra-Tender Brand)Supersweet (sh2, shrunken)sh2 types:sh2 types:Table SweetSynergistic types (Sweet Breeds, Triple Sweet)Sugar-enhanced (se, se+ EH)Normal (su)su and se types:su and se types:Figuring out which of these varieties need isolation from others can be complicated. Look to your seed company for specific information, but in general, keep su and se types isolated from sh2 types:Other improved geneticsOther improved genetics - In recent years, corn breeders have come up with a host of other varieties that are often different combinations of these three basic types. They include Synergistic types (Sweet Breeds, TripleSweets), Augmented types (Gourmet Sweet Brand, Multisweet, Xtra-Tender Brand), Table Sweet, and more. SupersweetSupersweet (sh2, shrunken) - These hybrids contain two to three times more sugar than normal hybrids, and the sugar in their kernels changes to starch very slowly after harvest. But they aren\u2019t as vigorous as normal hybrids, are more easily stressed by cold and other problems, and often lack the corny flavor or normal hybrids. They must also be isolated from Normal and Sugar-enhanced varieties pollinating within 10 to 14 days by at least 25 feet (250 feet for larger commercial plantings), or the kernels will be tough and starchy. Sugar-enhancedSugar-enhanced (se, se+, EH, Everlasting Heritage) - Fall between normal and supersweet hybrids in terms of vigor, stress tolerance, flavor, sweetness, and how quickly their sugar changes to starch. They do not need to be isolated from normal hybrids.NormalNormal (su) - These hybrids are flavorful, stress-tolerant, and vigorous growers. But they aren\u2019t as sweet as other hybrids and their sugar starts turning to starch quickly after picking. Hence the tradition of getting the water boiling before picking and shucking them.Sweet corn hybrids come in different levels of sweetness:Look for differences in kernel color (white, yellow, bicolor), ear size, sweetness (explained below) and days to harvest - early (55 to 70 days), midseason (71 to 85 days) and late (more than 85 days). Days to maturity are only estimates, and will vary considerably depending on growing conditions, most notably heat.Virtually all varieties on the market are hybrids. It is difficult to maintain vigor and sweetness in open-pollinated varieties.Varieties Smut - Pick and remove galls before they break open. Plant tolerant varieties: Top Notch, Temptation, Sweet Rhythm, Sweet Symphony, Zenith.Diseases:Seedcorn maggots - Avoid heavy manure or organic matter in garden, which attract adults and encourage egg laying. Do not overwater. Use insecticide-treated seed. Wear gloves when planting. Pests:For miniature or baby corn, plant seeds 2 to 4 inches apart and harvest as silks emerge from the ear, or harvest secondary ears from normally spaced plantings, allowing the main ear to fully mature. Also try hybrids specifically bred for early baby corn harvest. Corn is a heavy feeder - particularly of nitrogen - and may require several sidedressings of fertilizer for best yields. Look for signs of nutrient deficiency. Purple-tinged leaves are a sign of phosphorus deficiency. Pale green leaves are a sign of nitrogen deficiency. It is not necessary to remove suckers (side sprouts growing from the base of the plant). Studies show that removing them may actually reduce yields.Corn plants have many roots close to the surface, so cultivate around them with care. You can hill soil up around the base of plants as they grow to bury small weeds in the row and give the corn a better foothold. After the soil has warmed, you can mulch corn to help suppress weeds and retain moisture.To save space, you can intercrop corn with early-harvested cool-season crops.  For a sequential harvest, make first planting using an early hybrid. Two weeks later, plant another block of an early hybrid, plus blocks of mid- and late-season hybrids. Continue making plantings until late June, depending on the length of your growing season.Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart. Thin to 8- to 12-inch spacings when plants are 3 to 4 inches tall. Increase seeding rates to ensure a good stand if soils are cold or you are using seed that has not been treated with fungicide. (Untreated seed has natural color. Treated seed is dyed.)Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows of a single hybrid (as opposed to fewer, longer rows) for good pollination and well-filled ears. (Some corn varieties need to be isolated from others. See variety information below.)Make first planting after last frost date. Soil should be at least 65 F for fast germination. (Corn will not germinate if soil temperature is less than 55 F.) To speed increase in soil temperature, consider covering soil with black plastic for several weeks before planting.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 2 years.

Look for short-season varieties that will fruit under cool New York conditions. VarietiesDiseases:Cutworms - Use cardboard collars around transplants it cutworms are a problem. Colorado potato beetles - Handpick beetles, larvae and eggs.Flea beetles - Use row covers to help protect plants from early damage. Put in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot or plants start to flower.Pests:To help reduce disease, do not plant eggplants or other tomato-family crops in the same location more than once every three or four years. Pinch off blossoms 2 to 4 weeks before first expected frost so that plants channel energy into ripening existing fruit, not producing new ones.Eggplants are heavy feeders, but avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. They may encourage lush foliage growth at the expense of fruit.If season is cool, fruit set may be inconsistent.  Plants with heavy fruit set benefit from staking.Use row covers to protect plants from pests.Set transplants 18 to 24 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart.Consider using raised beds or black plastic mulch to warm soil and speed early-season growth. If using organic mulches to help retain moisture, do not apply until the soil has warmed.Wait until weather has settled, all chance of frost has passed and soil is in the 60s F before transplanting, perhaps 2 to 3 weeks after the average last frost date.

Other blanching alternatives include placing a flower pot over the plant, or covering with a cardboard disk or plastic container. Self-blanching varieties are available. Close plant spacing (about 8 inches) encourages self-blanching.For fall harvests, direct seed in garden about 2 to 3 months before expected fall frost.

Varieties found in supermarkets are most often softnecks. Includes Silverskin and Artichoke types.VarietiesDiseases:Pests:Plant large cloves to produce the largest bulbs. Plant smaller cloves at closer spacings or in patches for harvest as garlic greens. Save largest bulbs for planting your next crop. For larger bulbs, remove woody flower stalks (scapes) as they appear.  Bulblets at top of scape can be used in cooking.Mulch heavily after planting to prevent soil heaving - particularly with less-hardy elephant garlic varieties. Roots will begin to grow even though topgrowth may not be evident in late fall and winter. Remove mulch in spring, leaving only what is needed to suppress weeds.Break bulbs apart at planting time, keeping papery husks on the individual cloves. Plant with tips up, 2 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows 15 to 24 inches apart. Plant elephant garlic varieties about 3 inches deep and 8 to 12 inches apart.Using cloves from the supermarket is not recommended. They may carry diseases or have been treated to discourage sprouting. Most are also from varieties that are not well-adapted to New York's climate. Purchase bulbs from mail order suppliers, garden center, or other local source.In New York, plant from about the time of first fall frost to early November. If your soil is loose and well-prepared, you can plant in very early spring, but fall plantings usually yield more.Choose a weed-free, well-drained location. Raised beds are ideal. Do not plant where other onion family crops have been grown in the past 3 years.Maintenance and care: Propagate by division or separation - Cloves must be exposed to temperatures below 65 F or they may fail to form bulbs when planted.

You can harvest early like leaf lettuce or wait until heads form.   50 to 75 days.RomaineRomaine (Cos, var. longfolia) - Upright, elongated heads. (Some grow nearly 2 feet tall.) More tolerant of warm weather and less likely to bolt than other lettuce types. Red varieties as well as traditional light green. Most take about 70 days to mature.ButterheadButterhead (bib, loosehead, Boston) - Exceptionally good flavor and quality.   Forms loose heads with oily leaves. 55 to 75 days to maturity.LooseleafLooseleaf (var. crispa) - Easy to grow. Matures quickly. You can start harvesting leaves as soon as 4 weeks after planting. Great for early-season plantings. Wide variety of leaf shapes and colors. 45 to 60 days to full maturity.There are five main types of lettuce:VarietiesDiseases:Pests:For fall crops, time maturity around time of first expected frost.  Mature plants aren\u2019t as tolerant of freezing as seedlings.                     Use row covers to protect very early plantings from cold, to protect young plants from insects, and (supported by hoops) to shade crops when warm weather arrives.Moisture stress and high temperatures, particularly at night, encourage bolting. As the season progresses, plant more bolt-resistant varieties. Locate plants where they will be partially shaded by taller nearby plants, latticework or other screen.Lettuce has a shallow root system. Keep soil moist to keep plants growing continuously. Mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds (unless slugs are a problem). Make succession plantings every week or two.  Grow several varieties with different maturity dates for a continuous supply. Seeds need light to germinate, so do not plant too deep.Transplants:Transplants: Sow in 1-inch cells 3 to 4 weeks before transplanting outside. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 3 days before transplanting. Hardened plants should survive 20 F. Space crisphead transplants 12 inches apart in rows 18 inches apart. Space other varieties 6 to 10 inches apart in rows 12 to 18 inches apart.Direct-seeding:Direct-seeding: Sow seed 1/8 inch deep, 1 inch apart in rows 12 to 18 inches apart. When plants have two or three true leaves, thin to 12-inch spacings for crisphead varieties, 6 to 10 inches for other types. You can also lightly broadcast seed (particularly of looseleaf varieties) in a patch instead of a row.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 1 year.                  Days to emergence: 7 to 14       - Germinates in about a week at 50 F, 2 days at 70 F.            Germination temperature: 40 F to 85 F       - Seed can go dormant at high temperatures.

Also base your variety choices on disease resistance, fruit size (stick with smaller fruits in short-season areas or if you plan to trellis the vines), flavor, and color. When choosing varieties, match days to harvest with the length of your growing season. (Keep in mind that you will plant well after the last frost date and want to make sure your crop ripens well before first frost in fall.) If you have a long enough season, choose varieties with different maturity dates to spread out your harvest, or stagger planting dates of a single variety.Another group of melons, sometimes referred to as winter melons (C. melo v. indorus), are difficult to grow in New York outside of Long Island because they require a long, hot growing season. These include honeydew, Persian, Crenshaw and casaba melons. A fourth group of this variable species is C. melo v. conomon, which includes the Chinese cucumber or Oriental pickly cucumber.Typical eastern muskmelons (C. melo v. reticulatus) have heavily netted fruits with large seed cavities and a musky aroma and flavor. They are sometimes mistakenly called cantaloupes, which belong to the group C. melo v. Cantaloupensis and are seldom grown in North America.See separate listing for watermelon.VarietiesScab - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in day so aboveground plant parts can dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Cucumber mosaic virus - Remove and destroy infested plants. Eliminate perennial weeds such as milkweed, marshcress and yellow rocket and avoid planting next to susceptible ornamentals.Fungal leaf spot - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. In autumn, rake and dispose of all diseased leaves or fruit. Verify diagnosis.Fusarium wilt - Locate new plants in part of garden different from the previous year's location. Plant tolerant varieties such as Iroquois, Harper Hybrid, Saticoy, Pulsar or Athena.Bacterial wilt - Remove and discard or destroy infested plants. Eliminate perennial weeds such as milk weed, marshcress and yellow rocket and avoid planting next to susceptible ornamentals.Diseases: Flea beetles - Use row crop covers to help protect plants from early insect damage. Put in place at planting and remove at flowering. Control weeds.Squash bugs - Handpick. Bury or compost plant residues after harvest.Squash vine borer - Cut open vines and remove by hand.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests:To reduce insect and disease problems, avoid planting cucumber family crops (melons, squash, pumpkins) in the same spot two years in a row. For large plantings, leave a strip of rye cover crop every second or third row perpendicular to prevailing winds to protect plants from damaging wind.If growing melons on a trellis, support fruit with slings made from netting, fabric, or pantyhose. Trellising improves air circulation around plants and can help reduce foliar disease problems. Choose small-fruited varieties and reduce plant spacing.To prevent insect damage to developing fruits, place melons on pots or pieces of wood. Plants require consistent moisture until pollination. Once fruits are about the size of a tennis ball, only water if soil is dry and leaves show signs of wilting.If using fabric row covers, remove at flowering to allow pollination by bees.  Good pollination is critical to fruit set.Mulch plants after soil has warmed to help maintain consistent moisture and suppress weeds.Transplant at same spacings as direct-seeded crops - 2 to 3 plants per hill in hills spaced 4 to 6 feet apart, or 1 to 2 feet apart in rows 5 feet apart. Transplants are delicate and roots are sensitive to disturbance. If you need to thin, use scissors. Keep soil intact around plant when transplanting.For transplanting, sow seeds indoors \u00bc inch deep in peat pots (2-inch square or bigger), 2 to 4 weeks before setting out. Plants should have one or two true leaves when transplanted. Direct-seed 1 to 2 weeks after average last frost when soil is 70 F or warmer. Plant \u00bd inch deep, 6 seeds per hill, hills 4 to 6 feet apart; or 1 foot apart in rows 5 feet apart. Can plant at closer spacings if trellised.

Some bush varieties grow just 1 to 2 feet tall and need little or no support. Bush varieties produce a determinate number of flowers and fruit. Viny types may grow 5 to 6 feet or more and need trellising for good yields and easy picking. They continue producing an indeterminant number of flowers and fruit over a prolonged period.Dry peas or field peasDry peas or field peas (var. arvense):  You allow these to mature and harden, then dry, store and cook for soups and other dishes.Edible-podded peasEdible-podded peas (var. macrocarpon):  You eat the plump pods and peas together.  Often called snap peas.  Snow peas belong to this group, but have flat pods.Shell peasShell peas (var. sativum):  You remove the peas from the fibrous pod.  Some varieties (petite pois) are bred to be picked when small.Varieties fall into three major groups:VarietiesPowdery mildew - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart to allow air circulation. Eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation. Practice plant sanitation. When plants are not wet, carefully remove and destroy or discard affected plant parts. In autumn, rake and dispose of all fallen or diseased leaves and fruit. Wilt - Locate new plants in a part of the garden different from previous year's location. Plant as early as possible. Improve soil drainageDiseases:Seedcorn maggot - Avoid heavy manure or organic matter in the garden as they attract maggot flies and encourage egg laying.     Pests:Do not plant peas in the same place more than once in every 4 years. Avoid planting where in places where peas have suffered before from root rot. Do not use high-nitrogen fertilizers. Too much nitrogen will result in lush foliage but poor flowering and fruiting. Inoculation with rhizobia bacteria may be beneficial if peas have not been grown in the past.Sow fall crops about 8 to 10 weeks before first frost date. Fall crops can be disappointing if hot weather persists. Powdery-mildew-resistant varieties are best for fall crops.Intercrop peas with fast-growing cool-season crops such as spinach or radishes. After final harvest, follow with late squash plantings or fall-harvested cool-season crops such as broccoli, leeks or potatoes.Keep soil moist, but avoid heavy watering during flowering, which can interfere with pollination.  Erect trellis for tall-growing, vining types at planting using chicken wire, brush or other suitable trellis material. If trellising, increase row spacing to 4 to 6 feet.Plant seeds 1 to 2 inches deep, 1 to 4 inches apart in rows 18 inches apart. Or sow about 1 inch apart in a 3-inch-wide band (about 25 seeds per foot).   Shallow planting is best when soils are cool and wet. Plant deeper if soil is dry. A quick way to seed is to make a furrow or trench with a hoe, place seed in the furrow, cover and firm. Do not thin.Make additional plantings through early- to mid- May, or plant varieties with different maturity dates to increase the harvest period.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 3 years.

Potato varieties have a range of subtle flavors, too. Season:Season: Spread out your harvest by choosing early (ready to harvest in about 65 days), mid-season (80 days) and late (more than 90 days) varieties.When choosing varieties, consider:VarietiesViral diseases - Use certified seed.  Control aphids.   Sweet potatoes require warmer temperatures and a longer season.   Scab - Use certified seed. Locate new plants in a part of the garden different from previous year's location. Lower soil pH to 5.2 with sulfur. Plant resistant varieties: Chieftan, Norland, Russet Burbank, Russet Rural and Superior.The fungus that causes late blight has recently become a major threat to home gardens and commercial growers because of the migration of new strains (genotypes) into the United States. The disease can readily spread from home gardens to commercial fields. Verification of a late blight diagnosis and implementation of prompt control measures are highly recommended. The newly arrived strains are more aggressive than previous strains. Cultural control measures such as those listed above may not adequately control these new strains. Diseases:Leaf hoppersWash small nymphs off with a hard stream of water.     Flea beetles - Use row covers to help protect plants from early damage. Put in place at planting and remove before temperatures get too hot. Control weeds.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests:Use row covers to protect from Colorado potato beetles, leaf hoppers and flea beetles. Crush the yellow eggs of Colorado potato beetles on the undersides of leaves. Remove adults by hand. Potatoes need at least 1 inch of water per week from either rainfall or deep watering. Mulching helps retain moisture. Keeping the soil from drying out also helps reduce scab.A third method if you have excellent potato-growing soil is to plant seed potatoes 7 to 8 inches deep and skip hilling or deep mulching. The potatoes are slower to emerge, but this method requires less effort during the growing season. Deep planting is not good in cold, damp soils and it requires more work to dig the potatoes at harvest.Alternatively, snuggle seed pieces shallowly into the soil and cover with a thick layer of clean straw or other weed-free mulch. Add more mulch as needed to keep light from reaching potatoes. (A foot or more of mulch may be required.) Tubers grown this way can be easily harvested by pulling back the mulch after the plants die.When the plants are about 6 to 8 inches tall, \u201chill\u201d the potatoes by hoeing soil loosely around the base of the plants to within about an inch of the lower leaves from both sides of the row. Repeat in about 2 to 3 weeks. You may want to make additional hillings, gradually building a 6- to 8-inch ridge down the row. (Hilling keeps the developing potatoes from being exposed to sun, which turns them green and bitter. Green potatoes contain a chemical, solanine, which is toxic in large amounts.)One common way to plant potatoes is to dig a shallow trench about 4 inches deep with a hoe. Place the seed potato pieces with their eyes up (cut sides down) about 8 to 12 inches apart in the trench, and replace soil. Space trenches about 2 to 3 feet apart. Stems and foliage should emerge in about 2 to 4 weeks, depending on soil temperature.Plant about 2 to 4 weeks before your last frost date. The soil temperature should be at least 40 F. Do not plant where you've grown potatoes, tomatoes, peppers or eggplant in the past 2 years.If you want fast emergence, keep the bag of cut potatoes at room temperature until sprouts appear. Some varieties are slow to break dormancy and benefit from a 2- to 4-week \u201cpre-warming\u201d before planting. Others sprout in just a few days.A less risky practice is to put about 5 pounds of cut potatoes into a large grocery bag and fold the top closed. Keep the bag at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, then shake the bag to unstick pieces that may have stuck together. Let sit for another 2 to 3 days and then plant.Traditionally, cut seed potato pieces are allowed to cure for a few days to a few weeks before planting. This is because the cut potatoes need high humidity, plenty of oxygen and temperatures between 50 F and 65 F to heal quickly. If you have excellent, well-drained soil that meets those conditions, you can plant the seed pieces without curing. But if conditions are not right, the seed potatoes will rot in the ground.Cut seed potatoes that are larger than a chicken egg into pieces about 1 inch across or slightly larger. Each piece should have at least one \u201ceye\u201d (the bud where the stem will grow from) -- preferably two eyes. Egg-sized and smaller tubers can be planted whole. Buy certified disease-free seed potatoes from garden centers or through online or mail-order catalogs for best results. If you save your own seed potatoes, discard any that show any signs of disease. Avoid planting potatoes from the supermarket because they may have been treated with sprout inhibitors. They may also be less vigorous and more prone to disease. Unlike most vegetables, potatoes perform best in acid soil with pH 4.8 - 5.5. Use scab-resistant varieties with pH above 6.0. Because most other garden vegetables perform best at near-neutral pH, it\u2019s usually not feasible to grow potatoes in their preferred pH range, unless you dedicate one section of your garden to growing just potatoes in rotation with cover crops.Potatoes require well-drained soil. (They will rot under prolonged cold, wet conditions.) If your soil is poorly drained or a heavy clay, consider using raised beds. Adding organic matter (compost, cover crops, well-rotted manure or leaves) is a good way to improve soil before growing potatoes. Go easy on organic matter sources high in nitrogen (such as manure) and nitrogen fertilizer as too much nitrogen can encourage lush foliage at the expense of tuber production.Maintenance and care:      Days to emergence: 14 to 28       - Sprouts from seed potatoes should emerge in 2 to 4 weeks depending on soil temperature.

Squash vine borer - Remove by hand.Spider mites - Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. A hard stream of water can be used to remove many mites from plants.Squash bug - Handpick and destroy.  Bury or compost plant residues after harvest.Pests:Mulching plants helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. Mounding soil around the base of the plants can discourage squash borers from laying eggs. Black plastic mulch can speed growth, especially in cool, short-season areas. At the end of the season, remove or till in vines to reduce mildew. Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. Remove before flowering to allow pollination by insects or when hot weather arrives.If you need to start plants early, plant inside in 2- to 3-inch pots or cells 3 to 4 weeks before transplanting outside. Sow 3 or 4 seeds per pot and thin to one or two plants by snipping off the weaker plants to avoid damaging the roots of those that remain. Harden off by cutting back on water and reducing temperature before transplanting. Plant transplants out in the garden at the same final spacings above after all danger of frost has passed.Unless you are trying to grow a long-season variety in an area that gets early frosts, there\u2019s really no need to start pumpkins inside. Instead, direct seed 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep into hills (which warm and drain earlier in the season) or rows. Sow 4 to 5 seeds per hill. Space hills about 4 to 8 feet apart, depending on the size of the vine. (Even some of the mini-fruited pumpkins grow on very large vines.)   When the plants are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to 2 to 3 plants per hill by snipping off unwanted plants without disturbing the roots of the remaining ones. In rows, sow seeds 6 to 12 inches apart in rows 6 to 10 feet apart. Snip off plants to thin to one plant every 18 to 36 inches. Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 6 years.

Or follow radish harvest with summer succession crops such as beans, or fall-harvested crops.Can be sown in the same row with carrots, parsley, parsnips and other slow germinating crops. The radishes help to break soil crust for the weaker and later-germinating crops.Adding nitrogen fertilizer or nitrogen rich manure close to planting may produce lush tops and small roots.Keep soil moist for uninterrupted growth and best quality.Plant most winter varieties so that they mature around the first fall frost date. (Frost improves flavor and texture of most winter varieties.) Larger winter varieties need more space than spring varieties, so thin to about 6-inch spacings, depending on variety.For continuous harvest, make additional plantings every 1 to 2 weeks until temperatures average in the mid 60s F, or plant varieties with different maturity dates in a single planting. Resume planting when weather cools in fall. About 3 to 6 weeks before average last frost, direct seed \u00bd inch deep, 1 inch apart, in rows 12 inches apart. Thin to about 2-inch spacings. Crowded plants may not produce high-quality roots. Use thinings in salads.Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 4 years.

Pot with buds 1 inch below soil surface and keep outside for at least 8 weeks with temperature below 40 F. Move pot inside to cool, dark location. Keep soil moist, and rhubarb should be ready to harvest in about 6 weeks. (Stalks will be well-developed, but leaves will be small and yellow.) Replant outside in spring.Renovate beds when plants become crowded and leaf stems small (usually in 5 to 15 years) by dividing crowns and replanting in fall or spring.Horseradish makes a good companion crop, as both are long-lived perennials.Growth slows and flower stalks form when temperatures warm in summer. In cool regions, growth may continue if you have adequate moisture and remove flower stalks. In warmer areas, growth may resume in fall - sometimes enough for a light harvest. Remove flower stalks as they appear the first year to give strength to developing plant. Do not harvest any leaf stems until plants are well-established the second year. Removing flower stalks helps plants channel energy into leaf stem production.Mulch to suppress weeds and retain moisture. Plants require little or no fertilizer.Plant dormant crowns, as soon as you can work the soil in spring. You can cut crowns into pieces, but make sure each has at least one strong bud. Plant 1 to 3 inches deep and 2 to 3 feet apart.

Start transplants inside about 3 to 6 weeks before last frost.Make succession plantings every week or two until average last frost date. Use bolt-resistant varieties for later plantings. Sow again in mid- to late summer for fall harvest. Seeds do not germinate well in warm soil, so increase seeding rate to compensate. Or pre-germinate seeds by placing them between sheets of moist paper towel in a plastic bag and refrigerating until they sprout.Early planting is critical as dry soil, heat and lengthening days also encourage bolting.

Do not save your own seed.Powdery mildew - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in the day so aboveground plant parts will dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart and eliminate weeds around plants and garden area to improve air circulation.Diseases:Striped cucumber beetles - Construct tents of fine netting or cheesecloth or use floating row cover over young plants. Put in place at planting and remove before flowering. Control of beetles may be a factor in preventing bacterial wilt. Squash vine borer - Remove  by hand.  Butternut squash is resistant.Pests:Mulching plants helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. Mounding soil around the base of the plants can discourage squash borers from laying eggs. Black plastic mulch can speed growth, especially in cool, short-season areas. At the end of the season, remove or till in vines to reduce mildew. Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. Remove before flowering to allow pollination by insects or when hot weather arrives.If you need to start plants early, plant inside in 2- to 3-inch pots or cells 3 to 4 weeks before transplanting outside. Sow 3 or 4 seeds per pot and thin to one or two plants by snipping off the weaker plants to avoid damaging the roots of those that remain. Harden off by cutting back on water and reducing temperature before transplanting. Plant transplants out in the garden at the same final spacings above after all danger of frost has passed.Unless you are trying to grow a long-season variety in an area that gets early frosts, there\u2019s really no need to start winter squash inside. Instead, direct seed \u00bd to 1 inch deep into hills (which warm and drain earlier in the season) or rows. Sow 4 to 5 seeds per hill. Space hills about 4 to 8 feet apart, depending on the size of the fruit. (The larger the expected size of the squash, the larger the vine and the farther apart you should space the hills.)   When the plants are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to 2 to 3 plants per hill by snipping off unwanted plants without disturbing the roots of the remaining ones. In rows, sow seeds 6 to 12 inches apart in rows 4 to 8 feet apart. Snip off plants to thin to one plant every 18 to 36 inches. Maintenance and care:      Seed can be saved 6 years.

Also base your variety choices on disease resistance, fruit size (stick with smaller fruits in short-season areas or if you plan to trellis the vines), flavor, and color. When choosing varieties, match days to harvest with the length of your growing season. (Keep in mind that you will plant well after the last frost date and want to make sure your crop ripens well before first frost in fall.) If you have a long enough season, choose varieties with different maturity dates to spread out your harvest, or stagger planting dates of a single variety.VarietiesOther diseases:AnthracnosePhytophthora      Fusarium wilt - Locate new plants in a part of the garden different from previous year's location.   Plant tolerant varieties.Cucumber mosaic virus - Remove and destroy infested plants. Control cucumber beetles and aphids as soon as they appear.    Scab - Avoid wetting foliage if possible. Water early in day so aboveground plant parts dry as quickly as possible. Avoid crowding plants. Space apart for air circulation.Diseases:Flea beetles - Use row crop covers to help protect plants from early insect damage. Put in place at planting and remove at flowering. Control weeds. Squash bugs - Handpick.  Bury or compost plant residues after harvest.Squash vine borer - Cut open vines and remove by hand.Aphids - A hard stream of water can be used to remove aphids from plants. Wash off with water occasionally as needed early in the day. Check for evidence of natural enemies such as gray-brown or bloated parasitized aphids and the presence of alligator-like larvae of lady beetles and lacewings.Pests:Avoid planting cucumber family crops (melons, squash, pumpkins) in the same spot two years in a row.                     If growing melons on a trellis, support fruit with slings made from netting, fabric, or pantyhose. Trellising improves air circulation around plants and can help reduce foliar disease problems. Choose small-fruited varieties and reduce plant spacing.To prevent insect damage to developing fruits, place watermelons on pots or pieces of wood. Plants require consistent moisture until pollination. Once fruit are about the size of a tennis ball, only water if soil is dry and leaves show signs of wilting.If using fabric row covers, remove at flowering to allow pollination by bees.  Good pollination is critical to fruit set.Mulch plantings after soil has warmed to help maintain consistent moisture and suppress weeds.For transplanting, sow seeds indoors \u00bc inch deep in peat pots (2-inch square or bigger), 2 to 4 weeks before setting out.
