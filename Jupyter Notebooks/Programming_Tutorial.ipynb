    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be learning basics of programming in Python. The material in this tutorial will be directly relevant to both the Engineering Explores project, as well as your future programming pursuits. We intend for this tutorial as an interactive method to view how Python executes code, to develop core concepts for you to learn in order to complete this project, and as a guiding hand for help in case you get stuck while working on the project. In order to facilitate your learning, we will ask questions and have some exercises throughout the tutorial; please try to complete these exercises for your understanding and to develop the appropriate programming skills for this project. After completiong of this tutorial, you will be a stronger programmer and can complete the Greenhouse software component. You will also learn the basics of data visualization and gain an understanding of the machine learning used in this project.\n",

    "## How to use Jupyter for this Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like you to use the virtual environment for this tutorial. Everytime you use this tutorial, at the start, click on **Kernel**, **Change Kernel** and choose **Venv**. This will make sure you have the correct packages and version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter Notebook in this tutorial. Jupyter is interactive. On each cell of this tutorial, you can click on the cell, and it will be colored in green. Go to the top control bar. You can click **Run**, which will execute the code in the cell. If you need to stop execution, click the **Square** button to pause. If there is an error, or an issue in which Jupyter fails to work, navigate to the toolbar, click **Kernel** and **Restart**. You can also click **Kernel** and **Reconnect** if the Kernel becomes **Not Trusted.**\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter creates an environment to run Python code. In order to get the environment we want you to see, you must run the code from top to bottom, in that order, without skipping cells. **Skipping cells** might lead to inscrutable errors; in that case, just go back to the cell that you skipped and rerun it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, rerunning cells will cause issues with expected results, because rerunning cells might overwrite preexisting data. If you get strange results, such as answers changing from one run to another, just start again at the beginning of a section. You should get the expected answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add cells, click on **insert** and click the appropriate location for the insert. You will need to use this insertion to add cells in the tutorial, to complete appropriate questions and exercises. \n",

    "### Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "foo and bar were **variables** in the above example. **Variables** are like boxes that hold numbers, or even data. They allow us to reference data we find useful. For example Syntactically, we can assign a **variable** a value using **assignment**, using the **=** sign. That is, to assign a value to the variable, we could do **variable = value** substituting value with the value you want and variable with the variable name you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in Python, variable names can be alphabetical upper case and lower case, with underscores . Typically, we might make variable names memoriable. Also, we have two conventions for variables names: CamelCase and using underscores. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **CamelCase**, we have the first character capitalized, and joined together. Remember, No spaces between the words Camel and Case, because python will not recognize the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **underscores**, we can have variables like camel_case. This is also another valid and typical way to name variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ints\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably also noticed that the numbers 3 and 4 are like normal whole numbers. In Python, we call the type for these numbers ints. Ints represent integers, like 0, -2, 4, 5, -100, etc. Anytime you have a negative or positive whole number in Python, it is of type **int**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "In that example example, we said foo had the value 3 and bar had the value 4 in the above example. We could just as well change it; in Python, variables can change the values that they hold. Let's try making foo 5. We will assign foo the value 5. Let's also check what foo and bar are afterwards. We will use the print to help."

    "\n",
    "2. Try doing more complex operations and assigning that operation to a variable with your choice for the name. For example, you could do:\n",

    "### Order of operations\n",

    "```\n",
    "which python evaluates as 10 with order of operations, doing * before +. If we want to do the addition before the mulitiplcation, we can add parentheses. We use the rounded parentheses to denote the order we want python to evaluate. So, we could have:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    3 * (2 + 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "in which case Python would evaluate 2 + 4 first and get 6, then multiply by 3 to get 18. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use parentheses to change the order of execution in otehr places. Consider the expression:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    -10 ** 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "which python evaluates as (-10)**4 or 10000. But what if we really wanted the negation to be performed after the exponentiation. We could add parentheses again to tell Python our intended order of operations.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    -(10 ** 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will now give us -10000, which is the order we intended.\n",

    "#### EXERCISE: INTS and Floats\n",
    "1. Let's print some more. Help me print out x by filling in the blank.\n",

    "How can we store different values? For example, can we store decimals, or words, or even a collection of items like a shopping list in Python?

    "\n",
    "2. Also, in a second exercise, create one variable named first with your first name as the value. Next, create a second variable named second with your last name as the value. Make a third variable adding first and second together like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "where \n",
    "```python\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(full_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and see what the result is.\n",

    "3. Try using the + (plus sign) as to combine more strings together. Make an example with 4 strings, using one of the strings in another string. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Try to use the * sign with strings. Guess what it does. For a start, you can try:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"hello\" * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "and \n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"hello\" * 10\n",

    "You can try something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "favorite_food = input(\"Give me your favorite food: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that input prints the string \"Give me your favorite food: \", and then takes the value you want and puts in variable favorite_food.

    "## Functions:\n",
    "At the heart of programming is functions. Functions can be seen in three different ways. Firstly, Functions can represent actions, transforming an input into an output. In addition, functions are one of the ways we resuse code without copy and pasting. Finally, a third understanding of functions is that gunctions help us map an input to a known output, and are thus predictable. The transformative power of functions allows us to express and do more than we could without functions. Moreover, with code reuse and predictability, we can have an easier time reasoning that our code is correct. This means less bugs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Range()\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering what a function looks like: \n",
    "Actually, you've already seen a function: \n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "range()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action of Range\n",
    "In terms of an action, Range() represents creating a list of integers from start to end (excluding the end), incrementally increasing by 1. So range(1, 5) creates the list: [1, 2, 3, 4]. So the transformative action of this function is that it turns two numbers into a list with the above property of being incrementally increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Reuse in Range\n",
    "\n",
    "Range() allows us to reuse code because we can avoid writing our own range function all the time. Think how annoying that would be to have to keep copying code or writing new code! Now all we have to do is call this prepackaged piece of code someone wrote, and we will always get the expected list range() is supposed to give us. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictability of Range\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can see range() as a predictable mapping from input to output. Input range(5) and you will **always** get [1, 2, 3, 4]. You will never get [-1, 5, 6] or False or something else. You **always get the same output for the same input**!. That's one of the most powerful properties of functions, around which functional programming is built. We will not, however, cover functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Len()\n",
    "Here's another example of a function you've seen before. We'll perform the same explanation and analysis. We will talk about \n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "len()\n",
    "```\n",
    "which computes the length of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action of Len\n",
    "In terms of an action, Len() represents finding the length of a lst. So len([1]) is 1 and  len([2, 3, -4]) is 3. Notice how the function transforms a list to a number. That transformation is an action to change one quantity (the list) into another (an int).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Reuse in Len\n",
    "\n",
    "Len() allows us to reuse code because we can avoid writing our own len function all the time. Now, we can just use the prepackaged len() function that Python gives us to find the length of a list, without the need to write our own. If we wrote our own, we could have bugs in our code, which would be bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictability of Len\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can see len() as a predictable mapping from input to output. Input range([1]) and you will **always** get 1. You will never get 2 or -3 or something else. You **always get the same output for the same input**!. Try this out for different lists!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Our Own Custom Function\n",
    "It's all good to see functions that people made already and that we can use. But how about our own functions?Let's now see an example of a function we custom made.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a function example though? Consider a function that adds the numbers in a list. Let's see this in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll break down writing this function into steps:\n",
    "- First, we will consider the objective of the function, using some examples to see if understand what we need to do.\n",
    "- Next, we will implement the **body** of the function\n",
    "- We will then add the **arguments** which could require some abstraction based on the body code we have so far.\n",
    "- Additionally we complete the function by adding in the **return** statement, if needed (__return is optional__).\n",
    "- Lastly, we add a docstring or documentation to explain what our function does to other users who will call our function. The docstring is also for our own benefit, so that we do not have to go back and parse the code, but we just have to read the docstring to understand what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop our function below!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The objective is to sum the numbers in a list. We will assume the list wills only have integers in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means in our documentation, we should state that the list will only have integers. We will take this into account when we write our docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When writing a function, we should consider what the body of the function looks like. The **body of the function** is the meat of the function: it is what calculates the output. Here, we want to calculate the sum of the numbers of the list. So we will need to go to every element of the list and add it together. If we need to go to every element, we will need to have a loop of some sort. Let's use a for loop, since the list has fixed length l (e.g. the list we operate on will not change in length when we operate on it). \n",
    "\n",
    "We should probably have a total value to add each element on to for each iteration of the loop. This total value will represent the sum of the first n elements of the loop after the loop has finished n iterations (our **invariant**, you do not need to know about **invariants**, though they can be useful in proving correctness of code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since at the beginning, the loop has not finished an iteration, it has done 0 iterations at the beginnning. By our above logic, total then will be the sum of the first 0 elements of the loop, and so total should start at 0, since a list with 0 elements has no values in it whatsoever. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have the body of the loop done. Try filling in the code yourselve and make sure that this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, I will show what the body looks like. I will hardcode the list to the list [1, 2, 3, -6, 7], but you should be able to reason that the code should work for any other list.\n",
    "\n"

  },

    "There's the body! Pretty simple so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments \n",
    "Let's figure out what should what the **arguments** to the function should be. **arguments** are the **inputs** to the function. If the function is a machine that makes bread, then the inputs are flour and water and eggs. So the **arguments** to a breadmaking function are flour, water and eggs. Notice we had three **arguments** here. Some functions have one argument. If you had a function to eat bread, the only **argument** would be the bread! In another example,  the len() function only has one **argument**, the list (for which we want to know the length of)!. Finally, some functions have no arguments! How about a function that just prints (\"hello world\"). There's no need to have an input in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, **arguments** to the function differ between examples. For example, for the bread machine example, if you want bigger bread, put in more flour and eggs. If you want smaller bread, your inputs will change. The **arguments** control the change and the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's continue with our example. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What arguments do we need? Well, we want to be able to sum elements of a list, and presumeably, not all lists are the same. Since the lists can differ, it must be that the list is the argument. Thinking a little more, it seems like this is the only argument we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the syntax for writing this out?\n",
    "Well, arguments go in parentheses, between commas. You can have no arguments, or 1 argument, or as many arguments as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we name the function \"sum_lst\". We can name the function anything we want, so feel free to change it to some other name. To the left of  the function name is the keyword **def**. All functions must begin with **def** before the function name. This tells python that you are declaring a function with name \"sum_lst\". Finally, to the right of the function name is the arguments. Here we have on argument lst, and so our arguments are (lst).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have 5 arguments, x, y, z, a, b, our arguments would be (x, y, z, a, b).\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the finished declaration of the function with arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "def sum_list(lst):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Return\n",
    "4. We need to return a value to the user. **Return** gives the user the **output** of the function. We use the keyword **return** to return a value as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we return? Well, we can return the total variable, which has the total sum of the list after the entire list has been processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax looks like this:\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "return total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can return any value: for example, if we have a variable x we want to return, we can do:\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we want to return 2 + 3, we could do:\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "return 2 + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have nothing to return, we could omit the return. Functions in python do not need return statements, and thus, functions in python do not need outputs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the return keyword, but not return a value, you can omit the value. It looks like this:\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "return \n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice there is nothing after return. \n",
    "\n",

    "We have seen how functions work and how to write our own function. What if we want to use our own function, or someone else's function?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to be able to **call** a function. Calling a function requires you to know what the function does, what inputs it needs, and what outputs it has: this is exactly what the **specificaion** or **docstring** explains!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have identified those three items, we can call our function. The syntax looks like this:\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "function(arg1, arg2, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "for however many arguments are needed\n",
    "or \n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "if the function has no input arguments at all\n",
    "It's essentially just the function name, open parenthesis, arguments, close parenthesis.\n",
    "We can save the result of a function call into a variable if we want. To do this, we have\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "var = function(arg1, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "var holds the result of the function call. For example, if we call len() on the list [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "var = len([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then var holds the length of the list [1, 2, 3], and thus, var is equal to 3!\n",

    "You have seen functions being used to reuse code. Now, you will learn about classes. Classes are another way to reduce code. More importantly, classes allow us to crea abstract versions of objects we want to model; thus classes  are central to object oreinted programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will learn 2 different ways to understand the concept of a class: blueprints and sets of objects. In addition, we will talk about what an object is, what attrbutes are, and what methods are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is really a blueprint for an object. For example, consider an architect's blueprint. It represents a \"class\" of houses, but is not a house itself. To instantiate the 'class', we built an actual house. So the house is an **object**, while the **class** is the **blueprint** the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could have the house **class** like this:\n",
    "class house:\n",
    "    - number of windows\n",
    "    - number of doors\n",
    "    - number of bedrooms\n",
    "    - number of toilets\n",
    "    - number of people living there\n",
    "    - Owner's name\n",
    "    - House Address\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice this is like a **blueprint**: there are windows, but the number is not specified. The house blueprint could be used to construct actual house objects with 0, 1, or 100 windows (a really big house!). Likewise, other **attributes** of information for the house like number of  doors, number of windows, Address and owner's name are not specified because this is a **blueprint**. Of course an actual instance of a house would have these specified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now let's talk about **objects**. Continuing witj the same example, **ONE** house **object** could be:\n",
    "house1:\n",
    "    - 6 windows\n",
    "    - 4 doors\n",
    "    - 2 bedrooms\n",
    "    - 2 toilets\n",
    "    - 2 people living there\n",
    "    - \"Steve\" as Owner's name\n",
    "    - \"431 Smithfield Drive\" as House Address\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice in this actual house **object**, all the **attribute** fields of information are filled it. We have **instantiated** the house **class** with a house **object**. So instantiating turns an abstract blueprint into a concrete house, with all **attributes** filled in with values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been studying classes as blueprints for **instantiating** objects. However, there's another useful way of seeing classes. In general, classes are just a name for a set of objects. We've already worked with sets before; Remember, **types**? A **type** was a convenient name for the set of onbjects one could put data into. For example, the **int** **type** allows you to store integers, so **ints** represent the set of integers where integers are the objects in the set. Likewise, **strings** represent the set of characters combined together. Finally, **lists** represents sets of objects that were joined together like a laundry list. But these **types** were custom defined; how could you make a new type of set of objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is classes. Classes can allow you make **custom** **types**. Need a type for calendar dates? Make a class called date. Need a type representing animals? Make a class called animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the same pattern, here is an example of a class you are familiar with: The class of humans. Humanity is a set of people, and also a blueprint, since it is a general concept. Each human is an object of the class. **Attributes** are literally the characteristics of an object. So, our name, age, and year of school are attributes. We could even add more attributes like our social security number, our home address, etc. The skies the limit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding out the humanity example for extra attention:\n",
    "class humanity:\n",
    "    - age\n",
    "    - name\n",
    "    - year in school\n",
    "    - social security\n",
    "    - home address\n",
    "    - phone number\n",
    "\n",
    "\"John\":\n",
    "    - 50\n",
    "    - \"John\"\n",
    "    - Not in school\n",
    "    - 1111111111\n",
    "    - 234 5th street\n",
    "    - 309 - 102- 0192\n",
    " \n",
    "Now it's your turn: Let's do some exercises to udnerstand the concept of classes and objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise: Brainstorming classes\n",
    "1. Generate 5 different classes. Create 2 objects for each class, fully instanting the attrbutes of the object\n",
    "2. Brainstorm 3 different attributes for the class of Apples. Here's a starter: the type of apple, e.g. \"Granny Smith\" or \"Jonagold\"\n",
    "3. Brainstorm 3 different attributes for the job of Construction Worker. Here's a start: the time to start work, e.g. 5 AM.\n",
    "4. Brainstorm 3 different attributes for a Grocery Store. Here's a starter: the brand of the store, e.g. \"Walmart\" or \"Kroger\"\n",
    "5. Given a class representing a traffic light with two attributes: time since changing color, and current color, instantiate the class with 3 different objects. That is, state the attributes for the traffic light in three different ways\n",
    "6. I need a new type for a fixed length list, e.g. a list that only ever holds two items. Come up with as many attributes as you can to describe this fixed length list. Also, if you are up for a challenge, search up on Google about Python Tuples. \n",
    "7. I need a new type that represents a block of data in memory. The block of data could be of any size, and it has a type associated with it. Tell me as many attributes as you can come up with to describe the block of data type. \n",
    "8. Just creating classes is a bit boring. Let's manipulate the classes. Here's a class: the class representing Rational Numnbers (notice this is a type!). We can store rational numbers as a list of length 2, the top being numerator and the bottom as denominator. Come up with 4 operations that we can do on two **instances** of the rational numbers **class**. For simplicity, assume that whenever a rational number part of the **class**, it will always be fully reduced, e.g, 2/4 will be reduced to 1/2 automatically.\n",
    "9. Come up with a class representing the set of phone numbers and give attributes for this class. One attribute, for example, is whether the number is American, or European, or somewhere else. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Sensor Class\n",
    "Getting back to project: we will have a set of sensors and a set of peripherals in the greenhouse. It might be useful to have a class for sensors since we have a set for both. The sensor class could act as a type for the set of sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will define a class for a sensor. The sensor will have a variable noting whether it is activated or not. We call the variable (or **attribute**) active. The sensor starts inactive, so we set active to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the class below. IT is a class for sensors. An instance of the class Sensor is a specific sensor. Now run the class the below and take note of the different parts of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we **instantiate** the class? We need to have a function that builds the object and returns it back to the user. The builder function is called a **constructor**. Python has a unique syntax for constructors, with \n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "__init__(self):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Self is the name of the object you can create, **__init__** is the constructor. Notice that the constructor is located in the class. We put it in the class because it is part of the blueprint: it tells us how to make an **instance** of the class. Also, **constructors never have return statements**. You do not need to return self. So **remember to not add return statements in a constructor**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several things to note as you look through the syntax.\n",
    "1. The syntax for a class begins with the word \"class\" and is followed by the name, here, Sensor.\n",
    "2. The **__init__** function is a **constructor** for the class: it is responsible for building an object of the type class. So for example, if we were the architect, to create a house, we would call the init function\n",
    "3. To create the object, we do not call __init__, but we call the name of the class, Sensor. So use \n",
    "```python\n",
    "Sensor() \n",
    "```\n",
    "rather than __init__.\n",
    "4. Self represents the object. It is the _name_ of the object. For example, the address of the house that the architect builds would be the **self** for the house. Self allows for referencing the object just like the address of your home allows people to know where you live.\n",
    "5. In the cell after, I have created a sensor object in variable s. Self is not needed as an argument to the constructor, so there are no arguments in the function call"

    "And here is a sensor! You instantiated a sensor which you could maninpulate!But how can we manipulate the sensor. In the exercises earlier, we talked about how it would be nice to change objects, or even have objects interact with each other. We need functions to represent changes or interactions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back the to the sensor exaple: the sensor does not do much right now. You cannot turn it on. Let's add a method to turn on the sensor so that it can sense actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend the class with a **method**. A **method** is a function that resides in a class. It manipulates an object of the class. Here, we want a method to turn the Sensor on. Naturally, the method must know which object to change; it needs a reference much like the address to your home. Thus, it needs to have self as an argument. In general, all methods of a class need self as an argument to be able to manipulate the objects of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a method named turn_on, which has one argument self. It changes the **attribute** of self, active, to be True, representing on. Notice that the specification for the method follows the specification for the class, saying that active is true if the sensor is on. Also, the method does not return a value. This is ok, because self is set properly, which is what we want the method to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically, notice that the method is just a function inside the class. Also, note that the first argument is **self**, representing the object you are operating on. So if you turn_on a light sensor # 1, you would have **self** as light sensor # 1. Methods **must always have one or more arguments**, one of which is self. Finally, notice that methods are just placed inside of the class. This is show via the indentation level of the functions being indented inside the class definition on the first line."

There is also a quantity called duty cycles, for which the value is between 0 and 10. Finally,m Peripherals need an output channel, which will be a number in this example (it could be a GPIO Pin object if we wanted).

You may require to have a function call another function inside.\n",

We add a new method in the Light Sensor Class, the method change_intensity.\n",
