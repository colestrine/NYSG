    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be learning basics of programming in Python. The material in this tutorial will be directly relevant to both the Engineering Explores project, as well as your future programming pursuits. We intend for this tutorial as an interactive method to view how Python executes code, to develop core concepts for you to learn in order to complete this project, and as a guiding hand for help in case you get stuck while working on the project. In order to facilitate your learning, we will ask questions and have some exercises throughout the tutorial; please try to complete these exercises for your understanding and to develop the appropriate programming skills for this project. After completiong of this tutorial, you will be a stronger programmer and can complete the Greenhouse software component. You will also learn the basics of data visualization and gain an understanding of the machine learning used in this project.\n",

    "## How to use Jupyter for this Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like you to use the virtual environment for this tutorial. Everytime you use this tutorial, at the start, click on **Kernel**, **Change Kernel** and choose **Venv**. This will make sure you have the correct packages and version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter Notebook in this tutorial. Jupyter is interactive. On each cell of this tutorial, you can click on the cell, and it will be colored in green. Go to the top control bar. You can click **Run**, which will execute the code in the cell. If you need to stop execution, click the **Square** button to pause. If there is an error, or an issue in which Jupyter fails to work, navigate to the toolbar, click **Kernel** and **Restart**. You can also click **Kernel** and **Reconnect** if the Kernel becomes **Not Trusted.**\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter creates an environment to run Python code. In order to get the environment we want you to see, you must run the code from top to bottom, in that order, without skipping cells. **Skipping cells** might lead to inscrutable errors; in that case, just go back to the cell that you skipped and rerun it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, rerunning cells will cause issues with expected results, because rerunning cells might overwrite preexisting data. If you get strange results, such as answers changing from one run to another, just start again at the beginning of a section. You should get the expected answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add cells, click on **insert** and click the appropriate location for the insert. You will need to use this insertion to add cells in the tutorial, to complete appropriate questions and exercises. \n",

    "## Goals/Objectives \n",

    "\n",
    "foo and bar were **variables** in the above example. **Variables** are like boxes that hold numbers, or even data. They allow us to reference data we find useful. For example Syntactically, we can assign a **variable** a value using **assignment**, using the **=** sign. That is, to assign a value to the variable, we could do **variable = value** substituting value with the value you want and variable with the variable name you want. \n",
    "\n",

    "In **CamelCase**, we have the first character capitalized, and joined together. Remember, No spaces between the words Camel and Case, because python will not recognize the variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Ints\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably also noticed that the numbers 3 and 4 are like normal whole numbers. In Python, we call the type for these numbers ints. Ints represent integers, like 0, -2, 4, 5, -100, etc. Anytime you have a negative or positive whole number in Python, it is of type **int**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "In that example example, we said foo had the value 3 and bar had the value 4 in the above example. We could just as well change it; in Python, variables can change the values that they hold. Let's try making foo 5. We will assign foo the value 5. Let's also check what foo and bar are afterwards. We will use the print to help."

    "You have seen functions being used to reuse code. Now, you will learn about classes. Classes are another way to reduce code, and are central to object oreinted programming. A class is really a blueprint for an object. For example, consider an architect's blueprint. It represents a \"class\" of houses, but is not a house itself. To instantiate the 'class', we built an actual house. So the house is an **object**, while the **class** is the blueprint the house.\n",

    "Here is an example of a class: The class of humans. Humanity is a blueprint, since it is a general concept. Each human is an object of the class. **Attributes** are literally the characteristics of an object. So, our name, age, and year of school are attributes. \n",

    "1. The syntax for a class begins with the word \"class\" and is followed by the name, here, Sensor.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Sensor() \n",

    "rather than __init__.\n",

We add a new method in the Light Sensor Class, the method change_intensity.\n",

    "The lesson is to test extensively to hunt down bugs. We tried different represrntative tests, with 0, 1, 2 being small evens and odds numbers.We also tried normal cases like 4 and 5. Finally, we tried big even and odd numbers like 100 and 67.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you test, try to test the normal cases, and lots of edge cases like we did. Also, mever break the specificaiton: we say that n is a positive integer and can be 0. So we cannot test -1,-2, or any negative number."
